    "Random Forest Regressor is a type of ensemble learning algorithm used for regression tasks. It is an extension of the Random Forest Classifier algorithm and works by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the average prediction of the individual trees. Each tree in the Random Forest Regressor is built on a random subset of the training data and a random subset of the input features, making it less prone to overfitting and more robust to noise in the data. The final prediction is obtained by aggregating the predictions of all the individual trees. Random Forest Regressor can handle both categorical and numerical features, and can be used for both linear and non-linear regression tasks. It is widely used in machine learning for its high accuracy and robustness."

    "Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting in the following ways:\n",

    "\n",
    "Random Sampling of Training Data: During the construction of each decision tree, Random Forest Regressor randomly samples the training data with replacement. This means that each tree is built on a different subset of the training data, which helps to reduce the correlation between the trees and prevents overfitting.\n",
    "Random Sampling of Input Features: In addition to random sampling of training data, Random Forest Regressor also randomly selects a subset of input features for each tree. This means that each tree is built on a different subset of input features, which helps to reduce the correlation between the trees and prevents overfitting.\n",
    "Ensemble Learning: Random Forest Regressor uses an ensemble of decision trees to make predictions. The final prediction is obtained by aggregating the predictions of all the individual trees. This ensemble approach helps to reduce the variance and bias in the predictions and makes the model more robust to noise in the data.\n",
    "Pruning: Random Forest Regressor uses pruning techniques to remove branches from decision trees that do not contribute significantly to reducing the error. This helps to reduce the complexity of the trees and prevents overfitting.\n",

    "Random Forest Regressor aggregates the predictions of multiple decision trees by taking the average of the predictions made by each individual tree. This process is also known as bagging (bootstrap aggregating).\n",

    "During training, Random Forest Regressor constructs multiple decision trees on random subsets of the training data and input features. Each decision tree makes a prediction for a given input based on its own set of rules and splits.\n",

    "To make a prediction for a new input, Random Forest Regressor passes the input through all the individual decision trees and obtains a prediction from each tree.
